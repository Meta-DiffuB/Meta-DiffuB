## MetaBeta-Diffusion
![Image Alt text](/img/Meta_DiffuB.jpg)
Comparison between S2S-Diffusion model (i.e., Diffuseq) and the proposed Meta-DiffuB. The shades of color represent different amounts of noise being imposed. Different from prior works that use a fixed noise, we introduce a novel scheduler-exploiter framework, Meta-DiffuB, which achieves trainable noise scheduling inspired by Meta Exploration. Our Meta-B schedules contextualized noise, enhancing the training and generation of the S2S-Diffusion model, resulting in state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to previous S2S-Diffusion models, as detailed in Section 4.

## Datasets
We follows [DiffuSeq](https://github.com/Shark-NLP/DiffuSeq/tree/main) for the dataset settings.
Prepare datasets and put them under the `datasets` folder. 
Take `datasets/WA/train.jsonl` as an example. We use four datasets in our paper.
